Setting up VCR and WebMock for Testing

This project uses VCR and WebMock to record and mock external API requests during testing.
Before running any tests, make sure the test environment is properly configured.

1. Install test gems

By default, Bundler only installs gems from the :default and :development groups.
To include test gems such as VCR and WebMock, run:

<pre><code>
bundle config set with 'test'
bundle install
</code></pre>

(You only need to run the first command once â€” it will be remembered for future installs.)

If you prefer a one-time setup, you can instead run:

<pre><code>bundle install --with test</code></pre>

2. Run tests

Once installed, you can run individual test files like:

<pre><code>bundle exec ruby spec/spotify_api_spec.rb</code></pre>

3. About VCR cassettes

The first time a test runs, VCR will record real API responses into the directory:

<pre><code>spec/cassettes/</code></pre>


Subsequent runs will use the recorded responses, allowing tests to pass without making real API calls.
